Good day Dr. Bassel,

To run the online colab Juypyter notebook we provided a kaggle.json with working API credentials.
Please import this file to Colab after connecting to a remote session. This way, you will be able to import data
from Kaggle directly from colab without the need to pre-download the data

We orchestrated all commands in a chain of code blocks with relevant comments and informative text.

We also exported all of our findings to tabular forms and visual forms (charts) that can be inspected in the attached report.html file

Thanks in advance!
